            <h2>Books: Tyler</h2>
            <p>Tyler is a sophomore journalism major with a strong passion for 
                sports and storytelling. Outside the classroom, he is a 
                dedicated gym-goer and an avid football fan, interests that 
                fuel his understanding of athletic culture and competition. 
                A loyal Chicago Bears supporter, Tyler closely follows the NFL 
                and enjoys analyzing games, players, and team dynamics. 
                He aspires to become a sports writer after college, combining 
                his academic training with his firsthand appreciation for 
                fitness and athletics to deliver insightful, engaging coverage 
                of the sports world.</p>

        <div><h3>Barbells: Tory</h3>
            <p>Tory is a sophomore computer science major who balances the analytical 
            demands of technology with the discipline of collegiate track and field. 
            Although he only began taking an interest in sports a few years ago, his 
            involvement has grown into a strong passion, culminating in competing at 
            the collegiate level. Alongside his technical studies, Tory enjoys reading 
            philosophy and reflecting on questions of purpose, ethics, and impact. 
            With his computer science degree, he hopes to join a meaningful 
            organization that uses technology to improve everyday life, combining 
            recent athletic discovery, disciplined training, and thoughtful 
            problem-solving to create positive change.</p>

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>We’ve known each other since middle school, building a 
                friendship that has grown stronger over the years. Now 
                attending the same college, we continue to support one 
                another through academics, athletics, and everyday life, 
                just as we always have. From shared experiences to new 
                challenges, we push each other to be better while staying 
                grounded in trust and loyalty. More than classmates or 
                teammates, we’re best buddies who have grown together and 
                continue to move forward side by side.</p>
